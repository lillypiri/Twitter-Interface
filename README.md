WIP

To use this, set up a [Twitter App](https://apps.twitter.com/), with 'Read, Write and Access direct messages' permissions, then generate your keys and tokens in Keys and Access Tokens.

Set up a config.js file in the root directory with your Twitter keys/tokens like this:

```
module.exports = {
  consumer_key: "YOUR-CONSUMER-KEY",
  consumer_secret: "YOUR-CONSUMER-SECRET",
  access_token: "YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN",
  access_token_secret: "YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN-SECRET"
};
```

then  `npm install` & `npm start` and view it on http://localhost:7777/
